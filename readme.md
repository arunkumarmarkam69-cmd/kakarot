Technology has also changed the way teaching and learning occur in classrooms. Interactive tools such as smartboards, educational apps, and virtual simulations make lessons more engaging and easier to understand. Online learning platforms allow students to learn at their own pace, revisit difficult topics, and receive instant feedback. For teachers, technology simplifies lesson planning, grading, and communication with students and parents.

Another important impact is the development of essential skills. Through the use of technology, students gain digital literacy, problem-solving abilities, and collaboration skills that are crucial in today’s workforce. Online group projects and digital presentations prepare students for real-world professional environments where technology plays a central role.
